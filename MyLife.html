        <h1> My Life  </h1>

        <p4> <br> I am a recent graduate of Florida International University (Class of 2023), where 
        I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I completed two internships during my studies that enhanced 
        my technical expertise and professional skills. I am now preparing to pursue a Master’s degree in a specialized 
        field of computer science.As a passionate programmer, I am proficient in multiple programming languages, 
        including TypeScript, C, R, and JavaScript, and I am actively working to master Java, C#, and C++. Problem-solving 
        and learning drive me, and I approach challenges with determination and adaptability. Beyond my professional interests, 
        I am an avid gamer who enjoys strategy games such as Civilization VI , Humankind, and Stellaris, with a growing appreciation for
        the Crusader Kings. These hobbies reflect my analytical mindset and love for strategic thinking. 
        While navigating a challenging job market, I am determined to restart my career with a clear goal: to secure a fulfilling role 
        that enables me to achieve professional success and purchase a home by 2025. I am eager to embrace new opportunities, including 
        job offers and interviews, as I work toward this milestone
